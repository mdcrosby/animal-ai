# Some Example Scripts

This directory contains a few scripts that can be used as starting points for interacting with animalai. Note that some of the training scripts require additional packages to be installed to use - this should be obvious from the scripts.

- `play.py` shows how to load a configuration in player mode
- `lowlevelapi.py` shows off the ml-agents low level python api for intereacting with the environment and demonstrates inference with a hand-coded agent.
- `trainaai.py` shows how to use the ml-agents training. See the ml-agents repo for documentation.
- `gymwrapper.py` shows how to wrap animalai as a gym environment. 
- `watchmodel.py` gives an example of loading a trained model for viewing.
